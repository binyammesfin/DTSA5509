# Final Project-DTSA 5509: Machine Learning Model Comparison and Selection for Loan Default Prediction Analysis Using LendingClub Data
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model to analyze and assess credit risk for LendingClub by identifying key factors that indicate loan default. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the project aims to classify loans into two categories: default and non-default. The insights gained from this analysis will help LendingClub enhance its risk assessment processes and improve portfolio management, ultimately leading to better decision-making and reduced financial risk.

The data used is available at  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ethon0426/lending-club-20072020q1, as it could not be uploaded here due to its size. If you want to evalute the notebook, please download the file and put it in a folder named 'data'

The modeling covered:
- Logistic Regression: Baseline model to understand the data and initial performance metrics.
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Simple yet effective model for classification tasks.
- Decision Tree: A model that provides interpretability and captures non-linear relationships.
- Ensemble Methods:
    - Random Forest: An ensemble of decision trees to improve robustness and accuracy.
    - AdaBoost: An ensemble method that combines weak classifiers to create a strong classifier.
    - Support Vector Machine (SVM): Effective for high-dimensional spaces and various kernels.
- Advanced Models:
    - Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM): XGBoost and LightGBM

Details on data preprocessing, EDA, modeling, and evaluation are given in the notebook.
